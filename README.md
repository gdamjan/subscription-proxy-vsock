# `subscription-proxy-vsock`

The goal is to have a HTTP proxy that listens to http requests,
and forwards them to applications running in a VM over virtio-vsock.

Ideally, I would start any number of micro VM apps and they would automatically register with the proxy
(atypical to most proxies/load-balancers, but similar to mongrel2 or the uwsgi fastrouter/subscription).

http -> [vsock-proxy-lb] <- (== vm vsock ==) <- [vsock client connector + gunicorn]

The virtual machine will run with cloud-hypervisor started with `--vsock cid=10,sock=/tmp/cid10.sock`â€¦ TBD!


## Roadmap

A rough roadmap is 
https://github.com/gdamjan/subscription-proxy-vsock/milestones?with_issues=no

0.1)
  listeners for http and vsock (or its emulation)

0.2)
  ping/pong protocol

0.3)
  http request, http response in protocol

0.4)
  register cmd (regex: hostname/path)

2.0)
  tls

3.0)
  websockets
  request websocket:<uuid> ->
  <- connect websocket:<uuid>

4.0)
  http2

5.0)
  vm manager (cgi like)
